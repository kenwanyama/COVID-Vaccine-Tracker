 ********Introduction********
    
 Welcome to my project on visualizing global vaccination progress! This project focuses on tracking the vaccination efforts of countries around the world. It aims to provide an overview of key vaccine-related metrics, such as the total number of doses administered, the percentage of the population vaccinated, and the daily vaccination rate.
    
  The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the world, affecting millions of people and leading to a significant loss of life. In an effort to combat the pandemic, many countries have turned to vaccination as a key strategy. The development of safe and effective vaccines has been a major scientific achievement, and their widespread distribution is essential to controlling the spread of the virus. The vaccine rollout has been a complex and challenging process, with many countries facing logistical, financial, and political barriers. However, with the combined efforts of governments, healthcare professionals, and the public, the world is making progress towards achieving herd immunity and ending the pandemic. By tracking global vaccination progress, this project aims to contribute to the ongoing effort to combat COVID-19.
    
  The objective of this project is to investigate the relationship between a country's GDP and its vaccination progress. Specifically, the project aims to analyze whether there is a correlation between a country's economic status and its ability to achieve high vaccination rates. The project will use available data on GDP and vaccination rates to explore this relationship and provide insights into the factors that may impact a country's ability to vaccinate its population
    
    
 ********Aims and Objective********

- To track and visualize the vaccination progress of countries around the world using an interactive dashboard.
- To provide users with key vaccine-related metrics, such as the total number of doses administered, the percentage of the population vaccinated, and the daily vaccination rate.
- To allow users to explore the data at a global level or drill down to specific countries for insights into their vaccination progress.
- To monitor the progress of the COVID-19 vaccine rollout and contribute to the global effort to end the pandemic.
- To raise awareness of the importance of vaccination in controlling the spread of COVID-19.
- To provide a resource for researchers, policymakers, and the general public to better understand the global vaccination landscape

********Methods********

1. Obtain the dataset: The first step in creating the visualization project is to obtain the data set.
2. Connect Tableau to the dataset: Once the data set has been obtained, the next step is to connect Tableau to the dataset.
3. After connecting Tableau to the dataset, the next step is to design the worksheet. This involves selecting the appropriate charts and creating calculations to generate the desired metrics.
4. The final step is to create the dashboard by combining the worksheets into a single interactive display.

    Data Limitaion
  One potential limitation of this project is that the data used to create the visualization is slightly outdated, as it is not possible to obtain real-time vaccination data for all countries. Additionally, the data is static, meaning that it does not update automatically. This means that the dashboard may not reflect the latest vaccination progress of countries, especially if there are significant changes in the vaccination rates or policies. Users should keep this in mind when interpreting the data and refer to other sources to obtain the most up-to-date information on global vaccination progress. However, despite these limitations, the visualization provides a useful overview of the global vaccination landscape and allows users to explore the progress made towards achieving a fully vaccinated world.

 **Conclusions and future research ideas**

It is evident from the analysis that there is a positive correlation between a country's GDP and its vaccination progress. The higher the GDP, the higher the number of people vaccinated, on average. This trend is likely due to several factors, such as greater financial resources, better healthcare infrastructure, and greater access to vaccines. However, it is important to note that this correlation is not absolute and that there are several exceptions to this trend, with some countries with lower GDPs achieving high vaccination rates. Overall, the analysis highlights the importance of addressing economic inequalities and ensuring that all countries have access to vaccines and the resources needed to achieve high vaccination rates.

Future research Ideas

1. Investigate the specific factors behind the correlation between GDP and vaccination progress, including healthcare infrastructure, government policies, and other socio-economic factors.
2. Examine the impact of new COVID-19 variants on vaccination progress and whether countries with higher GDPs are better equipped to respond to these new threats.
3. Update the dataset regularly to provide the most up-to-date information on vaccination progress around the world, potentially using APIs or other automated data sources.
4. Explore the relationship between other economic indicators and vaccination progress, such as unemployment or poverty rates.
5. Analyze the impact of different types of vaccines on vaccination progress, including mRNA vaccines and vector vaccines. This could provide insights into vaccine distribution strategies and vaccine effectiveness
